      <p>Detroit was made in Paris, with other teams in the Philippines, China, Vietnam, and in india. The team Quantic Dream had 180 people involved in this game that took 4 years to make. When making the story, the writer director, David Cage, had to imagine where this story would take place. In his own words, he states ,“The city of Detroit was the first thing that had come very quickly to mind.” He explained that the city of Detroit already had an incredible story because of the history.</p>

      <p>For the look of the androids itself, they didnt want to make them too beautiful or too perfect because they wanted them to be both similar to rich and poor. For no confusion between android and human, they added an LED to the side of their head, a blue armband for the side, and a triangle on the front and back of their uniforms/outfits.</p>

      <p>Once they cast the actors for each of the characters, they meet the actors to scan the structure of their face, the colors, and patches with photography. When they get the details, they use this as an outline for the modeling and the creation of the characters. They use an artist to make the characters more realistic and create ideas which the team develops all together. Once they are done with their envision of the character, they will invite the actor to Quatic Dream (where they made the design) to help them think about how to act based on the look that they gave their character.</p>

      <p>To make the cameras look as real as possible for the gameplay and cutscenes, the team studied the optics (Ex. Law of rectilinear propagation, Law of reflection, and Law of refraction) and filming movement to copy the same optics of a real camera. Once the scenes are done being shot and proccessed by the animation department, they film the scenes to make it cinematic. They make sure the cameras are in the emotion of the scene and make sure that the actions must carry what should be felt. An example of this would be with the three main characters  Connor, Kara, and Markus. They wanted each of the characters to have their own style of photography, lighting, and key colors. For example, they wanted Kara to be more felt with a hand held camera to have something more leading and breathing. This fits very well with her character because Kara’s character is all about protecting Alice and leading her away from the danger. For Connor, they wanted something cold and perfect to match with how he was designed; to complete his mission with no flaws. Lastly, they wanted Markus to have something more spectacular and epic because of the large changes his character has based on what the player chooses.</p>
